# Open-Sourced-LUA
This is to learn or skid off of! If you do skid off of it give credits you lil skidder. 

This project (Open-Sourced-LUA) is used to learn off of to learn lua easier! you can see me reduce code with functions as well as things you can implement to make your scripts better! I have been coding in lua for about 6 years now and have an extensive knowledge for you to come and learn off of! All of my coding is things from what IVE learned and you can use this to better yourself in lua as well as optimizations and etc...

I am currently an admin at RScripts.net and owned several scripts!
